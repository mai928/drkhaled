     "There are many types of fibroids. Vaginal and abdominal sonar must be done to identify the location and size of the fibroid. Not all fibroids have an impact on the success of the operation. Based on this, it is determined whether they need to be removed before the ICSI procedure or not. If we cannot identify by ultrasound, it is recommended to perform a hysteroscopy in order to determine the effect of these tumors on the endometrium or not.":"There are many types of fibroids.
